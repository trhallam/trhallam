title: Recreating a Secret Santa App in Rust with WASM (Part 2)
authors: [trhallam]
tags: [rust, wasm, typescript]
---

I'm trying to learn Rust and WASM together and this seemed like an interesting project to pursue.
This part covers the frontend portion of the project and the integration into Docusaurus.

<!-- truncate -->

I've always been annoyed by how SecretSanta apps make you sign up and give them your email and other
details. They do make it simple in some ways but more complex in others. Then I found 
[this](https://github.com/arcanis/secretsanta/tree/gh-pages) very cool example. Which
uses an encrypted hash to hide details from a human observer but which can then be decrypted
to give a person their SecretSanta. Obviously this isn't how encryption was intended to be used
because the private key needs to be available to online application to decrypt the hash, but it serves
its purpose and means the App doesn't need to know someone's email address or even store their name.

Perfect for a static website like this!

The full code for the Rust implementation is available in this [repository](https://github.com/trhallam/super-secret-santa).
The front end forms part of this website.

## Scoping

The second phase of this project was to integrate the WASM package generated in Part 1 into this website as a 
Docusaurus [page](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages). Pages are a way to create custom one-off standalone 
web pages within your Docusaurus site that contain non-standard content such as a showcase or support page. They can
be compiled from React components (including your own) or Markdown.

The key components of the original Secret Santa were split into two pages. A landing with an introduction, form to input
the instructions and JS to generate the encoded links. The second page where the links lead to, was a simple message with
custom fields that decoded URL query string parameters to provide the viewer with the participant name (their name) and 
their secret santa match.

There is some complexity to these components, including the form and query strings as well as the WASM integration which
mean I decided to implement my frontend using React components.

## WASM packages in Docusaurus

Docusaurus uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle files into static assets. Webpack has recently made changes
to the way WASM is handled which meant that the feature must be optionally enabled. The way to achieve this in Docusaurus is
to write a custom webpack plugin for Docusaurus that modifies the Docusaurus webpack config to enable the feature.

The plugin for this website is called `custom-webpack` and lives in `./plugins/custom-webpack`. There is a simple `package.json`
and an `index.js` file with the modified config.

```js title="index.js"
export default async function customWebpack(context, opts) {
    return {
        name: 'custom-webpack',
        configureWebpack(config, isServer, utils, content) {
            return {
                output: {
                    webassemblyModuleFilename: "[hash].wasm",
                },
                module: {
                    rules: [
                        {
                            test: /\.wasm$/,
                            type: "webassembly/async"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                experiments: {
                    asyncWebAssembly: true,
                },
            };
        },
    }
}
```

The plugin is enabled via the `docusaurus.config.ts` file.

```ts title="docusaurus.config.ts"
const config: Config = {
  ...
  plugins: [
    require.resolve('custom-webpack')
  ],
  ...
}
```

After the bundling step, any WASM files found in packages are included as hash named `.wasm` files in the root of the 
website.

## Landing Page

The two main components on the landing page are the instructions and the input form. The instructions are just text with
some styling and inconsequential. All the magic happens in the form component. Initially I didn't have too much trouble
getting the form to work with the WASM package. This was because I was using Docusaurus in its local server mode via

```shell
pnpm run start
```

This command starts a local webserver to serve the content directly and supports hot loading and updates. The trouble
started when I went to build the website for deployment to Github pages.

```shell
pnpm docusaurus build
```

### WASM & Docusaurus SSR

Docusaurus uses a [mixture](https://docusaurus.io/docs/advanced/architecture) of server rendering and client side JS 
assets. The server side rendering of the React components
to HTML pages is done using Node and the client side rendering is prepared for the browser. WASM is specifically for the
client side and thus incompatible with the Node rending process. For reference, the error I would get came at the Bundling
stage after packages had been built. The error refers to webpack's use of `__dirname` to load WASM modules which is not
available outside the browser/DOM context.

It took a lot of troubleshooting a googling to come to that observation. More than I would have liked. The solution it 
seemed was to use the Docusaurus [escape hatches](https://docusaurus.io/docs/advanced/ssg#escape-hatches). Specifically,
the `<BrowserOnly>` component to prevent the application from being rendered server side and React's `useEffect` to load
the WASM modules dynamically during app loading.

The top level form component thus becomes a thin wrapper around a rendering function.

```typescript
export const SecretSantaForm: React.FC = () => {
    return (
        <BrowserOnly fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
            {() => { return render() }}
        </BrowserOnly>
    )
}
```

The WASM library is loaded within the rendering of the form, not at the top level of the Typescript. The bare bones 
implementation would look like this. With the variable `wasm` holding the super-secret-santa module. The empty dependencies
array for `useEffect` means that the module is loaded only once.

```ts
function render(): JSX.Element {
    const [wasm, setWasm] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        import("@trhallam/super-secret-santa").then(setWasm);
    }, [])
    return (
        <></>
    )
}
```

:::note

Note that the WASM package has been added as a dependency using the site `package.json`. The package is not served anywhere so it is added
from the `pkgs` folder of the site repository.

```json
"@trhallam/super-secret-santa": "file:../pkgs/super-secret-santa",
```

### Form & WASM

Generation of the Secret Santa links is handled by the form `onSubmit` handle and a special function. The function is
contained within the render function to ensure it has access to the WASM and so that the React state variables can be maintained.

The exposed WASM function `get_secret_santa` is called from the wasm state variable and passed the full instructions string
captured from the form `textarea`. The WASM is currently wrapped in a `try`-`catch` but could be reworked to provide more 
feedback to users.

```ts
function render(): JSX.Element {
    const [isGen, setIsGen] = useState(false);
    const [instructions, setInstructions] = useState("");
    const [pairs, setPairs] = useState<Map<String, Object>>(new Map());
    const [wasm, setWasm] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        import("@trhallam/super-secret-santa").then(setWasm);
    }, [])

    function handleSubmit(query): void {
        // Prevent the browser from reloading the page
        query.preventDefault();

        // Read the form data
        const form = query.target;
        const formData = new FormData(form);

        // Or you can work with it as a plain object:
        const formJson = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries());
        const instr = formJson.input.toString();
        let pair_map = new Map();
        // pass formJson.input
        setInstructions(instr)
        try {
            pair_map = wasm.get_secret_santas(instr);
        } catch (e) {
            console.log(e);
            console.log("Could not generate pairings.")
            return null;
        }
        // update state variables
        setPairs(pair_map);
        setIsGen(true);
        return null;
    }

    function handleAlter(): void {
        setIsGen(false);
        return null;
    }

    const renderInputOutput = () => {
        if (!isGen) {
            return emptyForm(handleSubmit, instructions);
        } else {
            const pair_map = Array.from(
                pairs.keys()).map(
                    (n, index) => (
                        <SecretLink name={n.valueOf()} secrets={pairs.get(n)} />
                    )
                );
            return (filledForm(handleAlter, instructions, pair_map))
        }
    }

    return (
        renderInputOutput()
    )
}
```

## Who (the secret link)

A second subpage under `/super-secret-santa` called `who` is where the secret links are directed to. 
[This page](/trhallam/super-secret-santa/who) returns
nothing meaningful by default (in fact an error). For users to see meaningful content they need to include the correct
query string with the URL in their browser. These are the links generated from the instructions by the form.

The `who` page passes the query string values back to WASM for decoding so that plain text of a persons Secret Santa match
can be displayed on the screen. This occurs in the `decrypt_secret_santa` function. Note that the server rendering must
again be avoided in this separate call to WASM.

```ts title="whomsg.tsx"
function render(): JSX.Element {
    const location = useLocation();
    const params = new URLSearchParams(location.search);
    const [wasm, setWasm] = useState(null);
    let who = "Unknown";

    useEffect(() => {
        import("@trhallam/super-secret-santa").then(setWasm);
    }, [])

    if (wasm) {
        try {
            let key = params.get('key');
            let iv = params.get('iv');
            let secret = params.get('secret');
            who = wasm.decrypt_secret_santa(key, iv, secret);
        } catch (e) {
            console.log(e);
            return <MsgError error="Could not decode url query!" />
        }
    }
    return (<MsgMatch match={who} name={params.get('name')}></MsgMatch>)
}

export const WhoMsg: React.FC = () => {
    return (
        <BrowserOnly fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
            {() => { return render() }}
        </BrowserOnly>
    )
}
```

## Notes & Issues

### Docusaurus and WASM

Integrating WASM packages into Docusaurus was not entirely straight forward. The webpack configuration needed to be modified
using a Docusaurus plugin and the places where WASM was imported need to be wrapped in a way to prevent SSR.

### Typescript

Because I utilised some browser specific references in my `tsx` files. The `tsconfig.json` needed to updated to reflect
those missing lib.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "lib": [
      "es2021",
      "DOM",
      "DOM.Iterable",
    ],
    ...
  }
```
