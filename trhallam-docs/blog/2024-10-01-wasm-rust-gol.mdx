Investigations of the [Rust WASM tutorial](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/) with Typescript.

<!-- truncate -->

I had been looking for an interesting project to play around with Rust for a while and I found one
(more on that in the future). But I had to first get acquainted with Rust again and more importantly
with its cross compilation to the WASM runtime. For this there is the 
[Rust WASM tutorial](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/)
which is a really nice comprehensive guide/intro to the topic. 

My repository of the final topic is [here](https://github.com/trhallam/wasm-rust-gol). And the Typescript version of the
tutorial is demonstrated on the [Game of Life Page](/trhallam).

Working through the example as it is was fairly straight forward and the Javascript implementation worked with no changes
required to the content at all. However, I like typing and I was interested to see where I could go with the Typescript
implementation, including some upgrades to the code and this is where things got a little bit interesting.

There are a few things to note about the Rust WASM tutorial beforehand however:

 - The versions used by the templates (e.g. create-wasm-pack) are quite old. Node spits out a lot of warnings. Upgrading
   creates some compatibility issues which I had to address during my conversion to TypeScript.
 - [`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) the package generator for Rust to WASM isn't 100% complete yet 
   when it comes to TypeScript, which also
   caused some issues.

## Setting Up

Follow the tutorial instructions for setup, including installing Rust and Node (or pnpm). For TypeScript you will need
to add the `typescript` node package.

```bash
$ pnpm install -g typescript
```

## Project setup

I wanted to place all my working for this example in a single repository. Hence I've moved the different parts of the example
into their own subfolders, for example, the Rust code is under the `rs` tree.

```bash
$ tree -L 1 ./wasm-rust-gol
wasm-rust-gol/
├── LICENSE_APACHE
├── LICENSE_MIT
├── README.md
├── rs
├── www
├── www.new
└── www.ts
```

The three versions of `www` represent different iterations of the Javascript/Typescript conversion.

 - `www`: The original Javascript implementation which is faithful to the Tutorial.
 - `www.new`: Updated packages including the webpack bundler but still in Javascript.
 - `www.ts`: Update packages and converted to TypeScript.

## Updating the Rust packages

The Rust package versions in the tutorial are a little out of date. So the first step was to update some values in the
`Cargo.toml` file of the `rs` package. Important changes are

```toml
[package]
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.93"

[dev-dependencies]
wasm-bindgen-test = "0.3.43"
```

The `edition` keyword manages the backwards compatibility of individual Rust crates. I'm not limited to using `2018` as in
the tutorial template so I've updated this to `2021`. The `wasm-` dependencies have also moved on since the tutorial template
was written and I've updated these to the latest stable releases.

When building the package I want to specify the output directory to outside the source tree. For me, this keeps the source
tree clean and means I can package everything into a single directory. Although I've specified the `--target` flag here, it
isn't strictly necessary, `wasm-pack build` uses `bundler` as the default target.

```bash
$ wasm-pack build --out-dir ../dist/wasm-rust-gol --target bundler
```

## Updating Javascript

### Creating a fresh project

After getting the original example working per the tutorial I wanted to make a few changes which have been captured under
`./www.new` in the repo. In this version of the example I have regenerated the Webpack package using the 
[Webpack CLI](https://webpack.js.org/api/#cli).

```bash
$ mkdir www.new
$ cd www.new
$ pnpm init
$ pnpm add --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
$ pnpm webpack init
```

Follow the prompts selecting `ES6`, `webpack-dev-server=Y`, `simplify-html=Y`, `PWA=n`, `CSS only`, `PostCSS=n`,
`extra-CSS-for-every-file=n`, `prettier-config=Y`, and `package-manager=pnpm` or alter individual values to suit your use
case. This will generate the `www.new` directory with the webpack templated files matching your responses to the prompts.

```bash
$ tree www.new
www.new
├── README.md
├── index.html
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── src
│   └── index.js
└── webpack.config.js
```

There are some key differences to the original `www` project structure. The Javascript source code now sits under `www.new/src`,
there is significantly more content in the `webpack.config.js` file and all of the webpack dependencies needed for your
project will be added to the `package.json`. You can edit some of the fields in the `package.json` to suit your project
(e.g. `version`, `description` and `name`.)

Importantly the local WASM package compiled [previously](#updating-the-rust-packages) needs to be added to the dependencies
which will allow us to import the package in the Javascript of our application.

```json
"devDependencies": {...},
"dependencies": {
    "wasm-rust-gol": "file:../dist/wasm-rust-gol"
  }
```
### Create `gol.js`

I decided to push all of the game of life Javascript into a separate file under 
[`./src/gol.js`](https://github.com/trhallam/wasm-rust-gol/blob/master/www.new/src/gol.js). This is the same as for
the tutorial example. In the example the `memory` variable imported from WASM looks like

```js
import { memory } from "wasm-rust-gol/wasm_rust_gol_bg";
```

but this resulted in an error for me. I had to change the reference to include the `.wasm` extension to make it work.

```js
import { memory } from "wasm-rust-gol/wasm_rust_gol_bg.wasm";
```

### Create `bootstrap.js`

`./src/bootstrap.js` also comes from the original example. It's purpose is to check and load the example from `./src/gol.js`.

```js
import("./gol.js")
  .catch(e => console.error("Error importing `gol.js`:", e));
```

The Webpack config must now also be modified to point to the `./src/bootstrap.js` as the entry point.

```js title="webpack.config.js"
const config = {
    entry: './src/bootstrap.js',
    ...
}
```

### Modify `index.html`

The `index.html` file was automatically created by Webpack when we initiated the package and it needs to be modified in
line with the tutorial. The `canvas` object is identified through its `id` to be replaced by the javascript in `gol.js`.

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>WASM-RUST-GOL-JSNew</title>
</head>

<body>
    <canvas id="game-of-life-canvas"></canvas>
</body>

</html>
```

### CSS

We could start the website now but first we will add some styling using CSS. This differs to the tutorial which put the
styling directly in the HTML template (`index.html`). Simply move the same attributes to the CSS document using a `body`
selector.

```css title="./stylesheets/base.css
body {
    position: absolute;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}
```

The CSS must then be loaded into the entrypoint for the package `bootstrap.js`.

```js title="./src/bootstrap.js"
...
import * as style_base from "stylesheets/base.css";
```

### Running the development server

Start the development server and Webpack's updated commands should automatically open the page.

```bash
$ pnpm run start
```

## Getting TypeScript working

Getting TypeScript (TS) working was a little more challenging than for the original and updated javascript versions of this
example. 

This version also uses SCSS styling over CSS but it practically makes little difference apart from some configuration options
for Webpack.

### Setup

Similar to the [javascript update](#updating-javascript) Webpack is used to setup a new package `www.ts` with a TypeScript
solution template from the prompt. The template includes some additional files over the javascript template. This includes
the TS compiler configuration `tsconfig.json` which needs to be configured and a tests folder.

```bash
$ tree www.ts
www.ts
├── README.md
├── index.html
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── src
│   └── index.ts
├── tests
├── tsconfig.json
└── webpack.config.js
```

Similar to the javascript packages we need to add the WASM package as a dependency to `package.json` and the install everything
with `pnpm`.

```json title="package.json"
  "devDependencies": {
    ...
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "wasm-rust-gol": "file:../dist/wasm-rust-gol"
  }
```

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

### `webpack.config.js`

Web Assembly has experimental support from Webpack for now and it needs to be enabled in the Webpack config for the modules
to load correctly. This is done setting the experiments key in the exported config variable. We also want to add an alias
for a stylesheets directory while here.

```js title="webpack.config.js"
module.exports = () => {
    config.experiments = {
        asyncWebAssembly: true
    }
    config.resolve = {
        alias: {
            stylesheets: path.resolve(__dirname, './stylesheets')
        },
    },
    ...
    return config;
}
```

### `tsconfig.json`

Creating some compatibility with WASM also needed compiler options to be specified in `tsconfig.json`. Through a bit 
of trial and error it became apparent that updates were need to the `module` and `target` versions of ES. Older versions 
didn't support the functionality necessary to run the application.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "es2022", // required for dynamic imports ERROR:TS1323
    "target": "es2018", // TS2468, TS2585, TS2712 all fixed by including more recent es version
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler", // TS2793 Can't find the wasm module
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*.ts"
  ]
}
```

### `gol.ts`

There were some issues in converting the `gol.js` to TS and I stumbled across this 
[tutorial](https://kernhanda.github.io/tutorial-typescript-canvas-drawing/) which used the canvas
object in a page. It inspired me to have a go at refactoring `gol.js` so that the game of life functionality was
encapsulated within a class.

The [results](https://github.com/trhallam/wasm-rust-gol/blob/master/www.ts/src/gol.ts) were fairly straight forward 
I think, and significantly improved the legibility of the example javascript. I also added a `sleep` function to slow
down the game simulation.

The conversion to TS was quite simple, and once the compilation issues were resolved it functioned equivalently to the JS
version.

### Issues with `wasm-pack`

Although the program will now run, it still reports a TS error from compilation.

```bash
[tsl] ERROR in /home/ahallam/dev/wasm-rust-gol/www.ts/src/gol.ts(6,24)
      TS2307: Cannot find module 'wasm-rust-gol/wasm_rust_gol_bg.wasm' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

Although some of the TS type definitions are added to our WASM package, the raw declarations are missing from the
`package.json` as outline in this [issue](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/issues/1193). We can resolve the error by
adding them to our `wasm-pack` created `package.json` and reinstall the package with `pnpm`.

```json title="package.json"
"files": [
    "wasm_rust_gol_bg.wasm",
    "wasm_rust_gol_bg.wasm.d.ts",
    ...
  ]
```

```bash
$ cd www.ts
$ pnpm install
```

Unfortunately, `wasm-pack` will overwrite the `package.json` each time you recompile the Rust crate. 
Hopefully this will get fixed soon!

### Final steps

Similar to the Javascript Update you will need to modify the `index.html` template and the add the SCSS styling. Checkout
the [repo](https://github.com/trhallam/wasm-rust-gol) if you are stuck.

### Running the development server

The TS version should now be working, start the development server and Webpack's updated commands should automatically open the page.

```bash
$ pnpm run start
```
