title: Recreating a Secret Santa App in Rust with WASM (Part 1)
authors: [trhallam]
tags: [rust, wasm, typescript]
---

I'm trying to learn Rust and WASM together and this seemed like an interesting project to pursue.
This part covers the Rust portion of the project.

<!-- truncate -->

I've always been annoyed by how SecretSanta apps make you sign up and give them your email and other
details. They do make it simple in some ways but more complex in others. Then I found 
[this](https://github.com/arcanis/secretsanta/tree/gh-pages) very cool example. Which
uses an encrypted hash to hide details from a human observer but which can then be decrypted
to give a person their SecretSanta. Obviously this isn't how encryption was intended to be used
because the private key needs to be available to online application to decrypt the hash, but it serves
its purpose and means the App doesn't need to know someone's email address or even store their name.

Perfect for a static website like this!

The full code for the Rust implementation is available in this [repository](https://github.com/trhallam/super-secret-santa).

## Scoping

The JS implementation I wanted to emulate for this project had taken an approach of serving JS in HTML alongside styling.
The codebase was compact but required a little deciphering to pull out the secret santa bits. The core of JS included three
main parts; the instruction parser, the secret santa algorithm and the encryption/decryption of matches. 

An important step in the scoping was choosing where to put the boundary between the Rust/WASM and the DOM rendering/styling.
Given the objectives of learning Rust, I wanted to try and put as much of the secret santa logic into Rust as possible but
decided to avoid DOM manipulations. As a side effect, the Rust implementation can also be used as a standalone library
by other code.

## Instruction Parser

Instructions for the Secret Santa are provided by the user as ASCII text. Each participant is labelled and then given a 
set of restrictions or an enforced pairing. For example, if `Ben` has no restrictions then the line is
```text
Ben
```

Labels can also be complex

```text
Ben (the older one)
```

If `Tom` cannot get `Ben` for secret santa then the blocked pairing label is prefixed by a `!` and the instruction is

```text
Tom !Ben
```

It is possible to give multiple blocked pairings as well

```text
Tom !Ben !Ben (the older one)
```

And we can force a match for one person to another using a `=` prefix.

```text
Tom =Jerry
```

Finally all text after a `#` is ignored as a comment.

### `struct Participant`

Each instruction about a participant represents the minimal amount of information needed by the secret santa algorithm.
To capture each instruction I implemented a struct capturing the Participant name or label, the pairing as an option and
the blocklist as an optional HashSet.

```rust title="participant.rs"
#[derive(Default, Debug, Eq, Clone)]
pub struct Participant {
    pub name: String,
    pub paired_with: Option<String>,
    pub blocklist: Option<HashSet<String>>,
}
```

If an enforced pairing (the `=` prefix) or a blocked pairing (the `!` prefix) are not supplied with an instruction then
we cannot set these values in the struct, hence they are kept as options. The `HastSet` is useful, because if a blocked
name is supplied twice it will only be added to the list once. HashSets enforce uniqueness of values in the set.

There will be some traits required for `Participant` to support the secret santa algorithm but these will be introduced 
in that section. For now, `Participant` just needs a constructor.

```rust title="participant.rs"
impl Participant {
    pub fn new(name: String) -> Self {
        Participant {
            name,
            blocklist: None,   // Default to None
            paired_with: None, // Default to None
        }
    }
}
```

### Instruction parsing

Instruction parsing can be broken down into a number of sequential steps.

 1. Remote comments from and white space around each line.
 2. Get the participant label.
 3. Get any blocked labels for 2.
 4. Get and enforced match for 2.
 5. Return a `Participant` with parsed values.

I approached this problem in a functional way using a mixture of Options and Results in Rust to handle errors. Line 
components are extracted or removed using the regex crate. The primary method I used to extract text from each line
utilised the `capture` method for a compiled regex. I found the regex crate somewhat more difficult to
use then similar libraries in other languages. A `Regex` instance has many methods that might be used for extraction and
they all return different structs. The key seemed to be to understand what traits the structs implemented so that the
captured text could be extracted. 

The function `get_instruction` which trims comments and whitespace is an example of this. `re.captures` returns an iterable
struct over the groups identified by the Regex. The iterable, which can only be of length one still needs to be post-processed
through the `map` and `extract` operations to get the necessary data.

```rust
fn get_instruction(instruction: &str) -> Option<&str> {
    let re = Regex::new(r"(^[^#]+)").unwrap();
    let Some((_, [inst])) = re.captures(&instruction).map(|cap| cap.extract()) else {
        return None;
    };
    Some(inst.trim())
}
```

The same process is repeated in subsequent regex extraction functions to get the participant name and rules.

## Secret Santa algorithm

### Algorithm

There are a few considerations when building the secret santa algorithm.

 1. We want people to be assigned randomly to other people.
 2. We need to observe the rules for all participants.
 3. Sometimes the rules might be too restrictive in that there aren't enough participants who a person can be matched with.

My approach to this can be broken down into the following steps.

 1. Create two sets of all names. `set_a` for givers and `set_b` for receivers.
 2. Check for any forced pairings and remove the giver from `set_a` and the receiver from `set_b`.
 3. Recursively generate one giver and receiver pair by:
     1. Sort `set_a` by the number of possible matches remaining in `set_b` accounting for rules.
     2. If `set_a` is empty everyone has been assigned, return OK.
     2. If the first participant has no possible matches, return error.
     3. If the first participant in `set_a` only has 1 possible match, make them a pair and update `set_a` and `set_b` then recurse.
     4. If the first participant has two or more possible matches, choose one at random, update `set_a` and `set_b` then recurse.

The sorting step is important because it gives the algorithm the best chance of finding a match for all people. We want to
ensure that participants with the fewest match options are prioritised when assigning the matches.

### Participant Traits

The development of the algorithm in Rust got slightly tricky when trying to cover different functionality. There are strong
limitations around certain structs (like `HashSet`) which needed some trial and error to understand. The `HashSet` type is
important in the algorithm because it allows the easy adding and removal of names from `set_a` and `set_b`. I also use a
`HashSet<Participant>` in a `SecretSanta` struct to hold the participants created during the parsing of the Instructions
and while generating pairings.

Firstly, there are a few traits that can be implemented on `Participant` to make referencing them in a `HashSet` easier.
This requires creating methods that facilitate comparisons between `String` types and Participants. The trait needed is
`PartialEq` for `String`. This directly compares a `String` to the `name` value of the Participant struct.

```rust title="participant.rs"
impl PartialEq<Participant> for String {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Participant) -> bool {
        self == &other.name
    }
}
```

The reciprocal can also be implemented allowing bidirectional comparisons.

```rust title="participant.rs"
impl PartialEq<String> for Participant {
    fn eq(&self, other: &String) -> bool {
        &self.name == other
    }
}
```

To make Participant hashable, the `Hash` trait should also be implemented. Here, the name is the important
value in the struct and will form the sole basis of the hash - ignoring the other values.

```rust title='participant.rs'
impl Hash for Participant {
    // Only need name in hash as it is the unique bit
    fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) {
        self.name.hash(state);
    }
}
```

The `String` comparisons and the `Hash` trait facilitate methods in `SecretSanta` like `get_name` and `contains` where 
`Participant` instances in a `HashSet` can be referenced with just a `Participant` instance that has the name only.

```rust title="secretsanta.rs"
pub struct SecretSanta {
    participants: HashSet<Participant>,
}

impl SecretSanta {
    /// SecretSanta contains recipient with name
    pub fn contains(&self, name: &str) -> bool {
        self.participants
            .contains(&Participant::new(name.to_string()))
    }

    /// SecretSanta get participant by name
    pub fn get_name(&self, name: &str) -> Option<&Participant> {
        let p = Participant::new(name.to_string());
        let part = self.participants.get(&p)?;
        Some(part)
    }
}
```

### `HashSet` limitations

After some experimentation in the algorithm it became clear that `HashSet` have issues around ordering.
Specifically, the Rust implementation does not guarantee the set order under iteration which means
sorting and indexing into the set are not possible.

The sorting issue was overcome by using a `BTreeMap`, an alternative to `HashMap`. The `BTreeMap` does
support ordering, so it was used when calculating the number of possible matches for givers in `set_a`.
`find_matches` is a method of `Participant` that looks for valid matches in the argument given the blocklist
rules. The insertion into the `tree_a` instance automatically sorts based on the key.

```rust title="snippet"
 let mut tree_a = BTreeMap::new();

for p in set_a.iter() {
    let Some(part) = self.get_name(p) else {
        return Err(SecretSantaError::new("Instructions issue".to_string()));
    };
    let n_matches = part.find_matches(&set_b).len();
    tree_a.insert(n_matches, part);
}
```

Indexing into the `HashSet` for selecting a random name in cases where more than one recipient are possible choices also
requires an ordered collection. The simplest solution was to transform the `matches` `HashSet` into a `Vec<&String>` which
contains ordered pointers to the names in `matches`. Then a random index can be chosen.

```rust title="snippet"
let matches = part.find_matches(&set_b);
let vec_matches: Vec<&String> = matches.iter().collect();
let pairing = vec_matches
    .choose(&mut thread_rng())
    .cloned()
    .expect("Something went wrong!");
```

The full algorithm is available in [`secretsanta.rs`](https://github.com/trhallam/super-secret-santa/blob/main/src/secretsanta.rs).

## Encryption / Decryption

I used the [RustCrypto](https://github.com/rustcrypto) crate collection for encryption in Rust. The documentation is a
little patchy and the broad use of traits can make understanding how the libraries fit together a little difficult. 
There are some limited examples for some of the crates but they aren't always direct copy and paste.

Similar to the original implementation I went for AES (`aes-gcm-siv`) and 256 byte key. AES is a symmetric encryption 
algorithm which means the same key is used on decryption. Although other security measures are needed like verification of
inputs in typical encryption processes, the objective here is only to obfuscate the paired name for use in a URL query string.

### Encryption

The encryption needs three arguments, the message, a suitable key and a nonce or initialisation vector. Usually the key
would be kept secret but we will provide all the information necessary to decrypt the message to the user.

The key and nonce are generated with the `generate_nonce` and `generate_key` functions. Note that `Key`, `OsRng` and others
come from a common `aead` crate while `Aes256GcmSiv` is implementations of traits associated with these base structs.

```rust title="crypto.rs"
use aes_gcm_siv::{
    aead::{generic_array::GenericArray, Aead, Key, KeyInit, OsRng},
    Aes256GcmSiv, // Or `Aes128GcmSiv`
    Nonce,
};
use rand::RngCore;

/// Generate a random nonce with 96bit fixed size.
pub fn generate_nonce() -> Nonce {
    let mut rand = [0u8; 12];
    OsRng.fill_bytes(&mut rand);
    let nonce = Nonce::from_iter(rand);
    nonce
}

// Generate a 256bit key
pub fn generate_key() -> Key<Aes256GcmSiv> {
    let key = Aes256GcmSiv::generate_key(&mut OsRng);
    key
}
```

A message can then be encrypted using the key and nonce.

```rust
pub fn encrypt(msg: &str, key: &Key<Aes256GcmSiv>, nonce: &Nonce) -> Vec<u8> {
    let cipher = Aes256GcmSiv::new(key);
    let ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(nonce, msg.as_bytes()).unwrap();
    ciphertext
}
```

The returned key, nonce and ciphertext are bit representations that are not compatible with ASCII or UTF-8 characters. 
This means it isn't directly usable in a URL query which we will need for the frontend. Instead, the bits must be
encoded into text. This can be done using the `base64ct` crate. Other bases are also available. The URL safe encoding
used here is helpful because it does not require an alphabet to be supplied.

```rust title="lib.rs"
fn encrypt_secret_santa(paired_with: &str) -> EncryptedSecretSanta {
    let key = crypto::generate_key();
    let nonce = crypto::generate_nonce();
    let ciphertext = crypto::encrypt(paired_with, &key, &nonce);
    let enc_ss = EncryptedSecretSanta {
        key: Base64Url::encode_string(&key),
        nonce: Base64Url::encode_string(&nonce),
        pairing: Base64Url::encode_string(&ciphertext),
    };
    enc_ss
}
```

### Decryption

Decryption occurs in the reverse order. First the encoded strings provided by the user are decoded. the `#[wasm_bindgen(catch)]`
is needed because this function will be exposed to the frontend.

```rust title="lib.rs"
fn decode_vec(input: &str) -> Result<Vec<u8>, SecretSantaError> {
    match Base64Url::decode_vec(input) {
        Ok(v) => Ok(v),
        Err(_) => Err(SecretSantaError::new(
            "Could not decode secrets".to_string(),
        )),
    }
}

#[wasm_bindgen(catch)]
pub fn decrypt_secret_santa(
    key: &str,
    nonce: &str,
    ciphertext: &str,
) -> Result<String, SecretSantaError> {
    let dc_key = decode_vec(key)?;
    let dc_nonce = decode_vec(nonce)?;
    let dc_ct = decode_vec(ciphertext)?;
    let name = crypto::decrypt(&dc_ct, &dc_key, &dc_nonce);
    Ok(name)
}
```

Examples of decryption from previously created keys were difficult to find, but the bit representations of the
key and nonce supplied by the user can be used to decrypt the ciphertext.

```rust title="crypto.rs"
pub fn decrypt(ciphertext: &Vec<u8>, key: &Vec<u8>, nonce: &Vec<u8>) -> String {
    let cipher = Aes256GcmSiv::new_from_slice(&key).expect("Key was incorrect");
    let nonce_ga: GenericArray<u8, _> = GenericArray::clone_from_slice(nonce);
    // let cipher = Aes256GcmSiv::new(key);
    let msg = cipher.decrypt(&nonce_ga, ciphertext.as_ref()).unwrap();
    String::from_utf8(msg).unwrap()
}
```

## Generate secrets

The final step was to combine the parsing of the instructions, the pairing and the encryption into an accessible interface
for the frontend. A little trickery was needed with `serde` to serialise the `HashMap` used for the secrets into a JS
compatible type - an Object of nested Objects in this case.

The `catch` property for `wasm_bindgen` allows for gracious handling of the `Result` with errors catchable within JS.

```rust title="lib.rs"
#[wasm_bindgen(catch)]
pub fn get_secret_santas(instructions: String) -> Result<JsValue, SecretSantaError> {
    let mut secret_santa = SecretSanta::new();

    // loop all lines
    for i in instructions.trim().split('\n') {
        secret_santa.add_instruction(&i)?;
    }
    secret_santa.generate_pairings()?;

    let pairings = secret_santa.get_pairings();
    let enc_pairings: HashMap<String, EncryptedSecretSanta> = pairings
        .iter()
        .map(|(k, v)| (k.clone(), encrypt_secret_santa(v)))
        .collect();

    match serde_wasm_bindgen::to_value(&enc_pairings) {
        Ok(v) => return Ok(v),
        Err(_) => return Err(SecretSantaError::new("Serialisation error".to_string())),
    }
}
```

## Notes & Issues

### Rust crates

Rust has a pretty small standard library which means there has been a lot of crate proliferation over the years. When
searching for a crate or set of crates to use it can be difficult to know what exactly to use. Often you'll be guided
by examples or when some crates have good documentation. Some crates or sets of crates seem to becoming the standard like
RustCrypto but there is no firm endorsements either way from core Rust.

### Rust and WASM

Initially I had worked from the [Rust WASM tutorial](../blog/wasm-rust-gol) which was structured in a way that it exported 
most of its functions to JS. I found that complex Rust structs/types didn't play nicely with WASM. Introducing non-standard
structs and types to JS requires a lot of overhead to manage serialisation and deserialisation using 
[serde](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/reference/arbitrary-data-with-serde.html).

Instead I opted to limit the interface between Rust and WASM/JS by keeping much of the internals Rust only. I then offered
a limited interface to JS through a couple of key functions. This meant moving everything into Rust (apart from frontend)
into Rust and it worked out in the end. 

### `rstest` crate

I discovered the `rstest` crate which was a good attempt to create Pytest like functionality in Rust testing. I wouldn't
say its as convenient but it makes things a bit easier. Especially repetitive fixture set up.
