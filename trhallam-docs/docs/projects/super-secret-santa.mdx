This [application](/super-secret-santa) is a shameless copy of another
[open-source project](https://github.com/arcanis/secretsanta)
but ported to TypeScript and implemented using a WASM compiled Rust library ðŸ¦€.
The front end is broadly similar in design but adapted for Docusaurus and React
while the internals are quite different. If you want to know more
about this project, please read the [blog post](/blog/super-secret-santa-1).
