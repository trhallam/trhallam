## Sharing directories between host and WSL

I found this useful for sharing my SSH configuration and keys between the host and the WSL subsystem.
These means keys can be installed once and used from both environments.

Modify your `/etc/fstab` on the WSL where you want to access windows files.

```title = "/etc/fstab"
C:/Users/<windows_user>/.ssh /home/<wsl_user>/.ssh drvfs rw,uid=1002,gid=1002,dmask=077,fmask=177,noatime,dirsync,mmap,access=client,msize=262144,trans=virtio
```

## Systemd Boot (for docker in WSL)

[WSL Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/systemd?source=recommendations)

This is good because it means you don't need docker desktop on Windows but it requires better management
of docker volume sprawl (see [Sparse Volumes](#sparse-volumes)).

```title = "/etc/wsl.conf"
[boot]
systemd=true
```
